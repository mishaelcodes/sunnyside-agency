## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/)
### What I learned

In the course of attempting this project, I learned about the javascript ```.contains()``` method which I used with the ```classList``` property to check if an element has a class and going further to use an ```if``` statement to make a decision based on whether it atrributes to true or false.

I also re-learned ```z-index: -1;``` which is a negative value to lower the display priority of an element. I used this on ```<a href="">LEARN MORE</a>``` after applying the ```:after``` pseudo class to it to achieve the expected result.

I definitely learnt more about how the css ```position: ;``` property to properly position elements on the screen as well as css ```@media screen``` to make the site responsive across all screen sizes.

### Continued development
I will continue to learn about the css ```grid``` property to better understand it and use it more often in future projects.


### Useful resources

- [CSS z-index](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index) - This helped me remember the negative values for the ```z-index``` css property, as well as the importance if reading documentations when I am stuck.
- [The ```picture``` tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_picture.asp) - This provided me with information on how to use the ```picture``` html tag which helps to specify the  source for more than one image based on screen sizes
